Return to Map of the Great Wheel with Sigil in the middle
Elar's hallway to his burning village, some spirit that brings life to dead things and death to live things. Essense of Nature after beating the creature in glorious battle 
Dothra's god Eldath blessed her with Shield of Faith as a Channel Divinity (10' radius, +2AC, Advantage on death saves)
Left that hallway, headed to the second last one: gelatinous cube fight
