Goblin man up on shelf being hassled by 3 Intellect Devourers
[[Orokuren]] the cartographer. Kill the IDs
- You've already got a map (from the start of the campaign)
- Rolls it out, "all wrong!"
- Gives us the map, rolls it out, think about the Marisin Manor and a house pops up SW of Falsehold. The location of the[[ Marisin Manor]]!
- Orukorun updates the maps all the time, keep it in the tube and it will reflect those updates
	- Buy a second one for 25gp 
- A book pops out from a shelf called **[[Orisin]] the Faithless**, take it, hide it.
- Orisin has taken some books as well
- Tell him we have found a way to the manor, keep the map a secret from him, confirm that with the group

Feel like around week has passed, only about 8 hours IRL has passed. 

- [ ]  Write interludes for next time!
