Last week:
Head to the secret warehouse of the scarred bandit.
Invisible and explore. Crates, party goes in.  
*Christmas episode*

Head into that warehouse, discover partitioned area behind wall of crates. Follow a ladder down a hole. Some guys boiling something in a room full of red mushrooms. Splash me. 

Fight with fat man. Kick him unconscious, tie him up. "Put a bag on his head, nothing is more terrifying than to wake up, bound,  in the darkness"
Red mushrooms are the bad kind, hence the poisoning.

Meet Calvatia
- Myconid caged in the cavern
- Spores to communicate with us. 
- Was captured and kept against his will so they could use his spores for stuff 
- Kills fat man horribly with spores
- Offers life bond (symbiosis)
	- Resistance to poison damage
	- Rapport spores: telepathic communication
	- Pacifying spores: Stun until damage
	- HP reduced to zero, spore cloud

- [ ] Theomas 'life bonds' with the myconid, talk to him about it. 

Come upstairs. See scarface and his goons. Scarface lights the building on fire.
Fight and talk to guards. 

Talk briefly with guard captain he says to make an appointment.

Combat:
- Need better descriptions of where people are and what they're doing
	- Grappling me and using me as a human shield is all good but do it through description instead of doing the description when you drop a gotcha on Jesse.
- Positioning of people (especially when it pertains to stealing the thunder of a nat 20) needs to be clearer if you're going to impose mechanical mods 
- Treating our characters like morons (eg. run in without looking around room is the same classic "oops you stepped in that open pit you didn't ask about")
-  Gotchas and traps:
	-  letting 3 of us try to open a door when there's an open one next to it
