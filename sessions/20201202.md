## Notes
*Location:* woods near [[Lifegarrin]]


See [[Rorek]], [[Jeffries]] kill some acolytes, they join us. Heal up, head into tunnel. Villagers are locked up in cave by vines, woman named [[Horetia]] held in cage made of spiderwebs with "fuse" running off further into the cave. 
Release villagers from their cage, cast darkness on the tunnel and shoot bolts at some of the acolytes coming out. Run villagers to the clearing and then to the stone wall we entered from. 

Big fight with [[Avendith Stargazer]]. 


## Important Points
[[Rorek]] notices the spiral symbol on the back of the dead acolytes (who appear to have been villagers), he and [[Jeffries]] exchange a glance. Says they must let [[Captain of the Guard]] in [[Falsehold]] know. 

[[Avendith Stargazer]] Has the same spiral symbol on her cloak
