## On Mental Health

My parents weren't cut out for the end of life. Cutting living tissue to fix and repair? Stitiching with weave enchanted sutures to ensure a successful healing? My mother and father thrive on it. But suturing dead flesh to make the dead more presentable to the living? No. Never.

My father admits now that when my sister and I were young and he would come home from the funeral rites of a small child or a suicide. He would come into our rooms and hold us tightly while we slept. 

In small towns like ours, many healers bury their own neighbours, friends and family members, and my father has overseen the funerals of my mother’s parents, his cherished cousin and his own father.

My mother acknowledges that in taking on professional responsibilities during a personal loss, they don't always allow the space to grieve properly. She certainly was too focused on the funerial rites to suffer the loss of my grandparents who had been a constant and doting presence my whole life... They called me their little miracle, tiny "Heldig"

In me, they got lucky. I always had a certain... affinity for the dead. There was a wall of silence 

Cleric of Dod referenced in the journal of Elma the Midwife. From the day I was born and I died, my mother died, and we were both reborn.

“Most of us have a narrative about death where we see it as entirely negative and we don’t look for the experiences that are beautiful and positive. We don’t see the times where death brings people closer together. We don’t see the love, the vulnerability that happens in death that happens nowhere else."

## Diamonds - Desire 
*The character tells a story about desire. It can be anything: material, relationship, a title, or whatever*


## Clubs - Tragedy or Violence
 *The character tells a sad or violent tale. This might be a great place to drop hints of past secret life*



## Spades - Victory
*The character tells a story about a time they were victorious. As with all categories, the concept of victory can take many forms.*


## Hearts - Love
*The character tells a story about love. It could be a person back home, a philosophical concept, or, perhaps, something more sinister*
