	Music - Bodhi
	Ocean - Dothra
	- Longing emptiness - Rastus 
		- Down and down to a deep level below the observatory
		- 50' square room
	
	
	A deep twisting hallway that goes down and down into cool dimness. 
	50' Square room with a black crystal shard floating in the center. An inky miasma flows out from the crystal turning into a fog that laps gently against a translucent light edge. 
	Feel drawn to the crystal, a deep longing inside needs to touch it. 
	Walk into miasma, grab the crystal. Miasma starts flowing up arms and feel at one. Womb.
	A voice: "Let's be whole again"
	Miasma starts lashing out at the group
	Rastus shouts at the rest to stay away, that it's scared. Takes some time and then the room calms down and absorbs into Rastus. 
	- Either +3 Sorc points or a shadow familiar
	
	Theomas: "You got lucky"
	Rastus: "Luck is just the outcome of our choices. You are lucky to have survived your ordeal"
	Theomas: "Through no action of yours!"
	Rastus *Wagging finger, walks away*
	
	Bohdi follows into the music hallway, tuneless music down into an inverted pyramid amphitheatre. Learns to control rage with music. Loses himself to music, cast Phantasmal Force to guide him out with a cha-cha line.
