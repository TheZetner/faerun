Me: 2x gold tickets
Buy some apples for snacks
Halfling holding a shortsword, shirtcocks it out of a window of the Elder Owl and a Tiefling woman looks out after him. 

Redeem tickets:
- 5 gold tickets to buy Bohdi a party favour (minor horn of annoyance)
- Spend one gold ticket on a wool blanket that auto rolls

Return to the Crow for some beers
- Meet Himisius "Tim" and old man looking to adventure
- Wants to join us on the hunt tomorrow. We agree, he registers us.

Talk with Theomas re: Katavan (his fungal buddy)
- Katavan assures Theomas that he won't hurt him

Great Hunt:
- Ursine Peak West of Falsehold 
- Large creature (wings like faerie fire) stealing cattle

Group up with Tim to join the Hunt
- [[Jatch]] with bandit looking group
- Hungover dwarves: south road
- Ser Hugh of *mumbles* who hired knights to join the hunt: direct path to mountain
- Kender: wide path around to peak
- Elves: wider path

Dwarves left before us
Kender and Tim go over a cliff in a landslide
Landslide seems to have been intentional as we found some sticks jammed in the rocks
Find Jatch and his bandits standing over the unconscious dwarves and a slashed up Coatl protecting its egg
Himisius and the Kender appear "You won't harm that creature!"
